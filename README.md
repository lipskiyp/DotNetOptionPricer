# Option Pricer

.Net / C# Option Pricer.

## Overview 

The aim of the project is to build a scalable comprehensive .Net / C# application for financial instrument pricing and data processing. 

Current iteration implements a number of classes to represent basic financial instruments (e.g. Pure Discount Bonds, Vanilla Options and Swaptions) as well as corresponding classes for Pricers and Option Greeks. 

A number of utility classes have been written for basic cash flow discounting, Date Deltas and Date Year Fractions calculations as well a Date Scheduler to generate fixing/payment dates etc. for instruments with custom complex payment schedules.
